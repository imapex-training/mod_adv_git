# Module: Advanced Git and GitHub

[item]: # (/slide)

## Abstract

Properly leveraging and navigating source control is critical to any developer working in a "modern" fashion.  Though there are many alternatives, git and GitHub remain the most popular and leveraged platforms for developers today.  Moving beyond the basics of repository creation, cloning, commiting and pushing can feel like learning an entirely new language.  However, successfully collaborating on projects require a solid skill set on branches, pull requests, issues, forking and managing remotes.  Not to mention how to react with the inevitable merge conflict.  We will cover all these topics and more in this hands-on module.

## Version Control 

![](images/vcs-single.png)

[item]: # (/slide)

Version Control Systems (more than appending "v1, v2, v#" that is) are not new to development.  Solutions like subversion have existed that allow developers to work locally and easily commit and track changes to code bases over time.  

[item]: # (slide)

## Distributed Version Control 

![](images/vcs-distributed.png)

[item]: # (/slide)

Git (and GitHub) are **Distributed** Version Control Systems.  The "Distributed" part indicates that the actual code base is not centralized to a single location.  In this solution, each developer maintains a "local" repository on their workstation where they can "commit" their work and changes.  Then they "push" the changes to a "remote" repository from which other developers can "pull" changes to their workstations.  

This distributed model enables teams of developers to more easily stay in sync with each other.  However, with multiple copies of the code base existing, there is a potential for conflicts to occure during the process of merging code together.  We will look at this potential and how to resolve during the lab session.  

[item]: # (slide)

## Client vs Server

![](images/git-logo.png)

### vs 

![](images/github-logo.png)

[item]: # (/slide)

Though often discussed like they are the same thing, **git** and **GitHub** are two different things, though tightly coupled.  

**git** is the Client application and specification for a distributed version control system.  

**GitHub** is a Server (or Service) providing Remote Repository services that leverages the git client and protocol.  In addition to simply providing remote repostiory storage for git users, GitHub also offers other development features to users that aren't specifically related to "git".  These include issue tracking, project management boards, metrics, etc.  

[item]: # (slide)

## Alternatives to GitHub

![](images/github-alternatives.png)

[item]: # (/slide)

Like many companeis before it (ie Xerox or Klenix), GitHub has basically become synomonous with "git" and is clearly the leading service for developers, however it isn't the only option for developers looking to host their code.  Some options include 

* [Gogs](http://gogs.io)
* [Phabricator](https://www.phacility.com/phabricator/)
* [BitBucket](https://bitbucket.org)
* [GitLab](http://gitlab.com)

[item]: # (slide)

## Alternative to git

![](images/git-alternatives.png)

[item]: # (/slide)

Just like GitHub isn't the only Service/Remote you can use, git isn't the only client a developer can leverage for version control.  Two other commonly used options are: 

* [Mercurial](https://www.mercurial-scm.org)
* [Subversion](https://subversion.apache.org)

Git (and GitHub) are the mostly commonly leveraged options however, and they will be what we cover in this module.

# Exercises 

[item]: # (/slide)

[item]: # (slide)

## Git and GitHub Basics Refresher

Let's start by reviewing the basiscs of getting started with git and GitHub in an independent fashion.  

*We will assume you've already installed the `git` client software on your workstation*

[item]: # (/slide)

[item]: # (slide)

## Client Setup `git config`
```git config --global user.name "Your Name Comes Here"git config --global user.email you@yourdomain.example.com```

[item]: # (/slide)

* So that you can get credit (or blame) for the work that you've contributed, you need to associate your name and email address with your work.  To do that in `git`, you use the `git config` command.

[item]: # (slide)

### Point of interest... what else can be configured 

```
$ git config -l

credential.helper=osxkeychain
filter.lfs.smudge=git-lfs smudge %f
filter.lfs.required=true
filter.lfs.clean=git-lfs clean %f
user.name=<YOUR NAME>
user.email=<YOUR EMAIL>
core.repositoryformatversion=0
core.filemode=true
core.bare=false
core.logallrefupdates=true
core.ignorecase=true
core.precomposeunicode=true
remote.origin.url=<REPO URL>
remote.origin.fetch=+refs/heads/*:refs/remotes/origin/*
branch.master.remote=origin
branch.master.merge=refs/heads/master
```

[item]: # (slide)

## Creating a New Repo

**Options for Starting**

* Create on GitHub first
* Create locally first

[item]: # (/slide)

Both work, there is no "right" or "wrong" way to do it, however the "simpler" method would be to create on GitHub first.  

However, there is no requirement that you leverage a remote server like GitHub.  If you are the only developer, and have no interest in sharing your work with others you could only work locally.  This is **not** the typical usage of git, so we will will assume you plan to share your code on GitHub.  

[item]: # (slide)

### Option: GitHub First

* Navigate to [github.com](http://github.com), login and click "New repository"

![](images/github-new-repo1.jpg)

[item]: # (/slide)

[item]: # (slide)

* Name your repository `imapex-git`.  Provide a description, make it Public, but do **not** initialize with a README

![](images/github-new-repo2.jpg)

[item]: # (/slide)

[item]: # (slide)

* You now have an empty repository on GitHub and are shown three options for starting out

![](images/github-new-repo3.jpg)

[item]: # (/slide)

The first option is for a truly new project where no code exists.  You can simply copy and paste the commands displayed into a terminal window (you should already be in a directory where you want your code to be located) to get started.  

The second option is when you already created a git repostiory locally and want to link it to the remote repository you just created.  

The last option would allow you to import code from a non-git project.  

[item]: # (slide)

* Create a local directory for your project (hint: name your directory the same as your repository name)

```
# Enter your base code directory 
cd ~/coding 

mkdir imapex-git
cd imapex-git
```

[item]: # (/slide)

[item]: # (slide)

* Copy and Paste the commands from the GitHub window.  **DO NOT just copy from the lab.  You need your own repository, not mine**

```
echo "# imapex-git" >> README.md
git init
git add README.md
git commit -m "first commit"
git remote add origin https://github.com/hpreston/imapex-git.git
git push -u origin master
```

[item]: # (/slide)

What these commands do: 

* `echo "# imapex-git" >> README.md`
    * Create a new text file called "README.md" with the contents "# imapex-git"
* `git init`
    * Initilizea a local git repostory in the current directory
* `git add README.md`
    * Add the "README.md" file to the repository
* `git commit -m "first commit"`
    * Commit the changes (the README file) locally
* `git remote add origin https://github.com/hpreston/imapex-git.git`
    * Link the remote repository on GitHub to your local version
    * "origin" is an alias for the remote repository.  You could name it anything, but convention is to use "origin"
* `git push -u origin master`
    * Send your local changes (ie commits) to GitHub

[item]: # (slide)

* Your final output should be

```
Counting objects: 3, done.
Writing objects: 100% (3/3), 228 bytes | 0 bytes/s, done.
Total 3 (delta 0), reused 0 (delta 0)
To https://github.com/hpreston/imapex-git.git
 * [new branch]      master -> master
Branch master set up to track remote branch master from origin.
```

[item]: # (/slide)

[item]: # (slide)

* Refresh the GitHub page and now you'll see your repository has been updated.  

![](images/github-new-repo4.jpg)

[item]: # (/slide)

There is now a copy of your repositroy (granted, there isn't much in there yet) on GitHub that matches your local copy.  If you had checked the box to "Initialize with a README" when creating it originally, you would have the same result.  

[item]: # (slide)

* With the remote copy, let's delete the local copy

```
cd ..
rm -Rf imapex-git

ls -la imapex-git
```
```
# Output 
ls: imapex-git: No such file or directory
```

[item]: # (/slide)

[item]: # (slide)

* Use `git clone` to create a new local copy from GitHub.  **(DO NOT copy and paste from the lab, you need to update the URL for your own GitHub Username)**

```
git clone https://github.com/hpreston/imapex-git
```
```
# Output 
Cloning into 'imapex-git'...
remote: Counting objects: 3, done.
remote: Total 3 (delta 0), reused 3 (delta 0), pack-reused 0
Unpacking objects: 100% (3/3), done.
```

[item]: # (/slide)

[item]: # (slide)

* Move to the directory and look at the contents 

```
cd imapex-git 
ls -la 
```
```
# Output
total 8
drwxr-xr-x   4 hapresto  wheel   136 Jan  5 14:15 .
drwxrwxrwt  32 root      wheel  1088 Jan  5 14:15 ..
drwxr-xr-x  13 hapresto  wheel   442 Jan  5 14:15 .git
-rw-r--r--   1 hapresto  wheel    13 Jan  5 14:15 README.md
```

[item]: # (/slide)

The `.git` directory is the actual repository informaiton locally.  The `.git/config` file has interesting information in it.  

[item]: # (slide)

* Look at the contents of the `.git/config` file

```
cat .git/config
```
```
# Output
[core]
	repositoryformatversion = 0
	filemode = true
	bare = false
	logallrefupdates = true
	ignorecase = true
	precomposeunicode = true
[remote "origin"]
	url = https://github.com/hpreston/imapex-git
	fetch = +refs/heads/*:refs/remotes/origin/*
[branch "master"]
	remote = origin
	merge = refs/heads/master
```

[item]: # (/slide)

Note the `[remote "origin"]` and `[branch "master"]` sections.  These indicate the key concepts related to the Distributed Version Control System is leveraged.  Branches will be discussed more later in the lab.  

[item]: # (slide)

## The Development Process

With the new repository created, we can begin to actually code.  A couple of key points: 

* Development is a continuing cycle of **Code -> Add -> Commit -> Push**
* Keep the mantra "Commit early, commit often" in mind
    * Small commits preferred over large commits
* Commits can be seen as "undo points"

[item]: # (/slide)

[item]: # (slide)

### Code

* Create a file `first.txt`.

```
touch first.txt
```

[item]: # (/slide)

[item]: # (slide)


* Open `first.txt` in a text editor, and add the message: `Our best thoughts came from others.`

    ***Feel free to use whatever text editor you prefer to do this***

* Look at the current contents of the file

```
cat first.txt 
```
```
# Output
Our best thoughts came from others.
```

[item]: # (/slide)

[item]: # (slide)

* Check the status

```
git status
```
``` 
# Output
On branch master

Initial commit

Untracked files:
  (use "git add <file>..." to include in what will be committed)

	first.txt

nothing added to commit but untracked files present (use "git add" to track)
```

[item]: # (/slide)

As you can see, `git` recognizes that there is a new file in the directory, and it knows that it's not being tracked.  

[item]: # (slide)

### Add

* Add `first.txt` to "stage" your work.  

```
git add first.txt
```

[item]: # (/slide)

An important concept in `git` is the "stage".  The "stage" is an intermediate phase where you can assemble your changes before you then "commit" your work.  This also allows you (if you like) to stage small modifications to the same file as you work on it.

[item]: # (slide)

* Execute `git status` again.  You should see the following:

```
# Output
On branch master

Initial commit

Changes to be committed:
  (use "git rm --cached <file>..." to unstage)

	new file:   first.txt
```

[item]: # (/slide)

Okay, you'll notice that there are now "staged" changes in the form of `new file:   first.txt`

[item]: # (slide)

### Commit

* Commit your changes

``` 
git commit -m "Add inspirational quote."
```
```
# Output
[master fdb6a07] Add inspirational quote.
 1 file changed, 1 insertion(+)
 create mode 100644 first.txt
```

[item]: # (/slide)
 
In order to store your changes in your git repo, you need to commit them.  Now that you have staged changes, you commit them by executing `git commit -m "Add inspirational quote"`.  The `-m "<message>"` is used to add a description of your changes in a human readable form.  As you gain experience with git, there are a lot of opinionated folks out there who can help you write excellent commit messages.  For now, we'll just keep it simple and move ahead.

Note that the number and letter combination `7be53cc` contained in `[master (root-commit) 7be53cc]`.  Yours will be different than the ones in this tutorial.  Git uses a SHA1 hash to file away your changes.  When someone asks you, "What's your commit hash?", this is the number they are asking for!


[item]: # (slide)

* Type `git status` again.  You will see git reply with:

```
On branch master
Your branch is ahead of 'origin/master' by 1 commit.
  (use "git push" to publish your local commits)
nothing to commit, working tree clean
```

[item]: # (/slide)

Here we can see that we have "nothing to commit", but we are "ahead of origin/master by 1 commit".  This indicates that we have made local changes that aren't reflected on the remote server.  

[item]: # (slide)

### Push

* Push your changes

```
git push
```
```
# Output
Counting objects: 3, done.
Delta compression using up to 8 threads.
Compressing objects: 100% (2/2), done.
Writing objects: 100% (3/3), 327 bytes | 0 bytes/s, done.
Total 3 (delta 0), reused 0 (delta 0)
To https://github.com/hpreston/imapex-git
   85bd49a..fdb6a07  master -> master
```   

[item]: # (/slide)

[item]: # (slide)

* Type `git status` again.  You will see git reply with:

```
On branch master
Your branch is up-to-date with 'origin/master'.
nothing to commit, working tree clean
```

[item]: # (/slide)

Now our local and remote copies of the repository are in sync.  If another developer were working on our project with us, they could `git pull` to retrieve our changes.  More on this next.  

[item]: # (slide)

## `git pull`


[item]: # (/slide)

"Pulling" changes is most relevant when working collaboratively on a project and not something you'll do often if you are working independently.  However, it is a basic feature of git that should be understood by anyone using it.  

In order to demonstrate it here, we'll do something a little unusual.  

[item]: # (slide)

* In the GitHub Repository, create a new file.  

![](images/github-create-file1.jpg)

[item]: # (/slide)

[item]: # (slide)

* Name the file `second.txt`, and add the text `This is a new file.`

![](images/github-create-file2.jpg)

[item]: # (slide)

* Scroll down and Commit the file.  Provide a description of `Create second.txt from web`

![](images/github-create-file3.jpg)

[item]: # (/slide)

[item]: # (slide)

* You'll now see that the remote repository on GitHub has both `first.txt` and `second.txt` 

![](images/github-create-file4.jpg)

[item]: # (/slide)

[item]: # (slide)

* Back on your local workstation, verify that you do NOT have second.txt locally with `ls -l` 

```
# Output
total 16
-rw-r--r--  1 hapresto  wheel  13 Jan  5 14:15 README.md
-rw-r--r--  1 hapresto  wheel  36 Jan  5 14:33 first.txt
```

[item]: # (/slide)

[item]: # (slide)

* Execute `git pull` to retrieve the remote changes

```
# Output
remote: Counting objects: 3, done.
remote: Compressing objects: 100% (2/2), done.
remote: Total 3 (delta 0), reused 0 (delta 0), pack-reused 0
Unpacking objects: 100% (3/3), done.

[item]: # (/slide)

[item]: # (slide)

* Verify `second.txt` was created

```
cat second.txt
```
```
# Output
This is a new file.
```

[item]: # (/slide)


[item]: # (slide)

## Handy Git Commands

* `git status`
* `git log`
* `git diff`
* `git reset`

[item]: # (/slide)

[item]: # (slide)

### `git status` 

```
$ git status -h

usage: git status [<options>] [--] <pathspec>...

    -v, --verbose         be verbose
    -s, --short           show status concisely
    -b, --branch          show branch information
    --porcelain           machine-readable output
    --long                show status in long format (default)
    -z, --null            terminate entries with NUL
    -u, --untracked-files[=<mode>]
                          show untracked files, optional modes: all, normal, no. (Default: all)
    --ignored             show ignored files
    --ignore-submodules[=<when>]
                          ignore changes to submodules, optional when: all, dirty, untracked. (Default: all)
    --column[=<style>]    list untracked files in columns
```

[item]: # (/slide)

`git status` is used to check the current status of the working environment compared to the local and remote repositories.  

[item]: # (slide)

#### Some examples we've seen

* Untracked Files 

```
$ git status

# Output
On branch master

Initial commit

Untracked files:
  (use "git add <file>..." to include in what will be committed)

	first.txt

nothing added to commit but untracked files present (use "git add" to track)
```

[item]: # (/slide)

Untracked Files indicate files that exist in the working directory, but have not been `git add`ed yet.  

[item]: # (slide)

* Changes staged

```
# Output
On branch master

Initial commit

Changes to be committed:
  (use "git rm --cached <file>..." to unstage)

	new file:   first.txt
```

[item]: # (/slide)

[item]: # (slide)

* Locally Repository ahead of Remote Repository

```
On branch master
Your branch is ahead of 'origin/master' by 1 commit.
  (use "git push" to publish your local commits)
nothing to commit, working tree clean
```

[item]: # (/slide)

[item]: # (slide)

* Local and Remote Repostiries in sync 

```
On branch master
Your branch is up-to-date with 'origin/master'.
nothing to commit, working tree clean
```

[item]: # (/slide)

[item]: # (slide)

### `git log`

```
$ git log -h
usage: git log [<options>] [<revision-range>] [[--] <path>...]
   or: git show [<options>] <object>...

    -q, --quiet           suppress diff output
    --source              show source
    --use-mailmap         Use mail map file
    --decorate[=...]      decorate options
    -L <n,m:file>         Process line range n,m in file, counting from 1
```

[item]: # (/slide)

`git log` displays the commit history.  

[item]: # (slide)

* Execute `git log` 

```

Date:   Thu Jan 5 14:03:34 2017 -0500

    first commit
```

[item]: # (/slide)

#### Sidebar: Short hash vs. full hash

In our previous step, we looked at the commit has that git presented to us: `7be53cc`.  You should notice that `7be53cc` is the first 7 characters of the full commit hash above: `7be53cc330db1207c9b26fe560704f90405742fd`.

[item]: # (slide)

### `git diff`

```
$ git diff -h
usage: git diff [<options>] [<commit> [<commit>]] [--] [<path>...]
```

[item]: # (/slide)

`git diff` describes the changes from one commit to another.  Provide either the long or short hash to specify specific commits, with the first commit being the "starting point" you are interested in.  

If you do NOT specify commits, the command shows differences between the last commit and the current working copy.  

[item]: # (slide)

* Pick two of your listed commits and run `git diff` on them.  

```
$ git diff 85bd49a1dce5983a7128f489f43cfc510ffad2f3 fdb6a077bfa19495d3238589b8c89a72cca0a24e

diff --git a/first.txt b/first.txt
new file mode 100644
index 0000000..d4425d9
--- /dev/null
+++ b/first.txt
@@ -0,0 +1 @@
+Our best thoughts came from others.
```

[item]: # (/slide)

[item]: # (slide)

### `git reset`

```
$ git reset -h

usage: git reset [--mixed | --soft | --hard | --merge | --keep] [-q] [<commit>]
   or: git reset [-q] <tree-ish> [--] <paths>...
   or: git reset --patch [<tree-ish>] [--] [<paths>...]

    -q, --quiet           be quiet, only report errors
    --mixed               reset HEAD and index
    --soft                reset only HEAD
    --hard                reset HEAD, index and working tree
    --merge               reset HEAD, index and working tree
    --keep                reset HEAD but keep local changes
    -p, --patch           select hunks interactively
    -N, --intent-to-add   record only the fact that removed paths will be added later
```

Occasionally you may find yourself having done some coding that didn't really work out how you hoped.  Or you may mistakenly delete something that you wish you hadn't.  If you are following the "commit early, commit often" mantra, this doesn't have to be a big deal.  

`git reset` enables you to go back in time to a particular commit, immediately wiping out any changes you've made.  There are a whole lot of options available, but we'll look at the one that does a "hard" reset.  

[item]: # (slide)

* Open up `first.txt` and add the line `This is all a mistake.`  To the end.  

```
$ cat first.txt

Our best thoughts came from others.
This is all a mistake.
```

[item]: # (/slide)

[item]: # (slide)

* Use `git status` to verify that the file has been modified.

```
On branch master
Your branch is up-to-date with 'origin/master'.
Changes not staged for commit:
  (use "git add <file>..." to update what will be committed)
  (use "git checkout -- <file>..." to discard changes in working directory)

	modified:   first.txt

no changes added to commit (use "git add" and/or "git commit -a")
```

[item]: # (/slide)

[item]: # (slide)

* Use `git log` to find the hash of your most recent commit

```

[item]: # (/slide)

[item]: # (slide)

* Execute `git reset --hard 4600bcecad83434ee50cf35e5697842e0f10faf0` to undo the changes.  **(Use your commit hash in the command)**

```

In this section we'll look at some of the options available for not breaking working code.  Or in other words, how developers can work on new features, fix bugs, or experiment in a low risk fashion.  

[item]: # (slide)

## Code Branches 

* Used to develop features
* isolate changes
* repos maintain a default branch, usually master
* can be merged into other branches

[item]: # (/slide)

Let's say you have a new feature that you're working on.  You might have to refactor some of your code, and you want to be able to checkin your changes as you make progress.  However, you don't want to box yourself in a corner and prevent easy changes to your production code.  In order to manage this type of situation, you need to isolate your changes, and so you should use `git` branching.

[item]: # (slide)

### `git branch <branch name>` 

```
$ git branch -h

usage: git branch [<options>] [-r | -a] [--merged | --no-merged]
   or: git branch [<options>] [-l] [-f] <branch-name> [<start-point>]
   or: git branch [<options>] [-r] (-d | -D) <branch-name>...
   or: git branch [<options>] (-m | -M) [<old-branch>] <new-branch>
   or: git branch [<options>] [-r | -a] [--points-at]

Generic options
    -v, --verbose         show hash and subject, give twice for upstream branch
    -q, --quiet           suppress informational messages
    -t, --track           set up tracking mode (see git-pull(1))
    --set-upstream        change upstream info
    -u, --set-upstream-to <upstream>
                          change the upstream info
    --unset-upstream      Unset the upstream info
    --color[=<when>]      use colored output
    -r, --remotes         act on remote-tracking branches
    --contains <commit>   print only branches that contain the commit
    --abbrev[=<n>]        use <n> digits to display SHA-1s

Specific git-branch actions:
    -a, --all             list both remote-tracking and local branches
    -d, --delete          delete fully merged branch
    -D                    delete branch (even if not merged)
    -m, --move            move/rename a branch and its reflog
    -M                    move/rename a branch, even if target exists
    --list                list branch names
    -l, --create-reflog   create the branch's reflog
    --edit-description    edit the description for the branch
    -f, --force           force creation, move/rename, deletion
    --merged <commit>     print only branches that are merged
    --no-merged <commit>  print only branches that are not merged
    --column[=<style>]    list branches in columns
    --sort <key>          field name to sort on
    --points-at <object>  print only branches of the object
```

What that does is to allow you to make changes in an area that won't affect the `master` branch.  One convention in `git` is that the main branch is typically named `master`.

Now you're basically operating in a parallel universe until you merge your changes back into `master`.

[item]: # (slide)

* Create a new branch called "shakespeare"

```
git branch shakespeare
git branch
```
```
# Output

* Now, you need to switch to your branch.

```
git checkout shakespeare
```
```
# Output

```

[item]: # (/slide)

[item]: # (slide)

* You can shorten this into a single command with the `-b` flag for `git checkout`

```
git checkout -b chaucer
git branch

```
```
# Output #2

 * [new branch]      shakespeare -> shakespeare
Branch shakespeare set up to track remote branch shakespeare from origin.
```

[item]: # (/slide)

The first time you push a new branch to GitHub you need to use the option `-u` to "set-upstream" for the branch.  What the command says is "Please push the current working branch up to the remote I call 'origin' and create a new branch there called 'shakespeare'".  

It is important to understand that though it is good practice, it is **not** required that the name of a branch be the same in local and remote repositories.  If you were to use a command like `git push -u origin bob`, you would create a new branch in the GitHub instance of the repository called "bob" that was linked with yoru local branch called "shakespeare".  

Where this typically becomes a problem is if you use the command `git push -u origin master` from within a branch.  This will result in your local branch being linked to the `master` branch on GitHub.  Not something every done intentionally.  

[item]: # (slide)

* Take a look at `.git/config` to see what this linkage looks like.  

```
$ cat .git/config

[core]
	repositoryformatversion = 0
	filemode = true
	bare = false
	logallrefupdates = true
	ignorecase = true
	precomposeunicode = true

	url = https://github.com/hpreston/imapex-git
	fetch = +refs/heads/*:refs/remotes/origin/*
[branch "master"]
	remote = origin
	merge = refs/heads/master
[branch "shakespeare"]
	remote = origin
	merge = refs/heads/shakespeare

With `git merge` you can add commits from one branch into another branch.  This is typically done as part of integration testing, and when the time comes to incorporate new features or fixes into the main "master" branch.

### Merge Conflicts

[item]: # (/slide)

It won't be long before you attempt a `git merge` and encounter the dreaded "merge conflict" alert.  This happens whenever two commits are making changes to the same part (ie line) of a file.  There is nothing wrong with two commits working on the same file, but if the same line has been edited this is not something git can automatically work through.  

Though this can occur when working independently on a project, it is much more common when working collaboratively with others.  The method the developer resolves a merge conflict is the same whether you cause the conflict on your own, or if you and another developer were working on the same code.  

[item]: # (slide)

***We are going to purposely casue a conflict so we can fix it!***

* When a merge conflict occurs, git uses these indicators to surround the conflict
    * `<<<<<<< HEAD` 
        * Inserted a line before the point of the conflict

    * `=======`
        * Inserted at the end of the point of conflict 
        * *A conflict could be 1 or more lines of code/text*

#### Merge Notes

* If you decide you do NOT want to complete the merge, you can run `git merge --abort` instead
* Many IDEs provide graphical interfaces for resolving merge conflicts that simplify the process
* Some merge conflicts can result in many instances of conflicting lines across multiple files
    * The same process is used to resolve, but it can be more complicated 
    * In cases like these, rather than merging into `master` directly, an integration branch can be safer 
    * Keeping commits and feature branches small is a good to try to limit these cases

## Forking and More

* Forking a Repository
* Using GitHub Issues
* Issuing Pull Requests
* Managing Upstream Remotes

[item]: # (/slide)

In this section we'll look at the basics of working with someone else's code.  We'll talk about:  

* Using "forks" to use another repository as a starting point for a project.  
* How you can file issues against a repository if you find a bug or have a feature request.  
* Explore how the Pull Request provides a developer the abiltity to contribute code to another person's project
* Linking your local repository to multiple remote repositories to stay in sync with upstream changes

[item]: # (slide)

## Forking

* a copy of a repository
* make changes w/o impacting source repo
* long lived
  * a new project based on existing work
* short lived
  * proposing changes to someone elses repo

[item]: # (/slide)

Forking and Branching are mechanisms used by Git to diverge from the main code line for feature development, or bug fixes. Branches are seperate trains within the same repository, whereas a fork, creates a copy of the entire repository in a different location (user account). From the perspective of a single developer the two are very similar, however, it is important to consider what other developers are doing relative to the project. The fork based workflow is dominant in opensource projects as contributors likely would not have access to push code to the main repository.

## GitHub Issues 

* Keep track of bugfixes
* Track enhancements
* Provide a forum for discussion about your code
  * supports github flavored markdown for references to PR's, code, mentions, etc
* Asignment, Milestones and Labels allow you to organize issues in a meaningful way

[item]: # (/slide)

Issues are the primary vehicle by which feature enhancements and bug fixes are tracked.

Labels are used to categorize the the issue. Examples of tags are enhancement, *bug*, *question*, *help wanted*.

 A detailed explanation of Issues, Labels, and Milestones can be found [Here](https://guides.github.com/features/issues/)

***TIP:*** 
To close an issue in the same repository, use one of the keywords in the list below followed by a reference to the issue number in the commit message. For example, a commit message with `Fixes #45` will close issue 45 in that repository once the commit is merged into the default branch.

If the commit is in a non-default branch, the issue will remain open and the issue will be referenced with a tooltip.

## Pull Requests

* notify others of your changes
* request that they "pull" those changes into their work and merge them
* issued from:
  * forked repository
  * branches in the same repository

[item]: # (/slide)

Pull requests are the way of notifying others about changes that you've checked in and you want incorporated into the main project.  Pull requests can be issued from a forked repository, or from a branch within a single repository.

[item]: # (slide)

* Add, commit and push the changes to GitHub

```
git add CONTRIBUTORS.txt
git commit -m "Added Hank Preston to Contributors list"
git push
```
```

* On GitHub, you can see that your info is now listed in **YOUR** repository

![](images/github-pr1.jpg)

[item]: # (/slide)

You have now written the code to fix the Issue you filed, but that code is only in your FORK of the repository, not the original repo.  We can ask that the Upstream repository "PULL" our changes into it by opening a "Pull Request"

[item]: # (slide)

* In GitHub in your repository, click the "New pull request" button

![](images/github-pr2.jpg)

[item]: # (/slide)

[item]: # (slide)

* You'll be given a chance to view the changes, and then click "Create pull request"

* Remember, you can include key words and Issue numbers in the PR title to automatically link them together.  

![](images/github-pr4.jpg)

[item]: # (/slide)

* After opening, you'll be taken back to the PR list on the upstream repository.

### Pull Request Notes

* Only owners of a repository can "Merge" the Pull Request into the code 
* If your running this lab during a class, the proctor can do that if they wish 
* However, multiple students submitting PRs at the same time, on the same file will likely cause merge conflicts that need to be addressed
* Repository owners typically won't resolve conflicts like that themselves
    * They will ask you to "rebase" your changes

[item]: # (/slide)

As a contributor to a project, you can open issues and pull requests, but it is up to the owner of the project to decide what to do with them.  On active projects, "merge conflicts" are quite likely, and often are the cause for extra work by the contributor of code.  

What can often happen after submitting a Pull Request is: 

1. Another PR that conflicts with your changes is merged into the repository
2. This causes a conflict on your PR
3. The repository owner will submit a comment on your PR asking you to "rebase" your changes

This request means "Thanks for your submitted changes, we'd love to take a look, but before we can we need you to resubmit them against our current code base"

### Exercise Note

If you are running this exercise indepently and not with a proctor, the following steps related to the conflict and rebasing will NOT work exactly as listed.  

If this is the case, the commands to create the new remote, pull from upstream, and pull from upstream with rebase can still be ran, but the output may differ

### Pull Request with Conflict

### What to do next... 

* Update your respository with the "upstream" changes
* Rebase your code changes
* Potentially close the original PR and open a new PR

## Syncing a Repository to multiple Remotes

**Remember:** 

* "Distributed" Source Control = Multiple Copies
* "origin" is just an alias that points to your GitHub Repository
* The commands `git push` and `git pull` take an optional argument referencing the remote
* "Upstream" is a common name for a repository that was the source of a "fork"

[item]: # (/slide)

[item]: # (slide)

![](images/upstream-diagram.jpg)

* `git pull upstream` to retrieve changes
* You typically can't `git push upstream` due to permission issues
* You `git push origin` and use Pull Requests to submit changes to upstream

[item]: # (/slide)

[item]: # (slide)

* Add a new remote to your local repository for "upstream"

```
git remote add upstream https://github.com/imapex-training/101-github-lab
git remote -v
```
```
# Output 

origin	https://github.com/hpreston/101-github-lab (fetch)
origin	https://github.com/hpreston/101-github-lab (push)
upstream	https://github.com/imapex-training/101-github-lab (fetch)
upstream	https://github.com/imapex-training/101-github-lab (push)
```

[item]: # (/slide)

[item]: # (slide)

* Pull the changes from upstream

```
git pull upstream master
```
```
# Output

From https://github.com/imapex-training/101-github-lab
 * branch            master     -> FETCH_HEAD
Auto-merging CONTRIBUTORS.txt
CONFLICT (content): Merge conflict in CONTRIBUTORS.txt
Automatic merge failed; fix conflicts and then commit the result.
```

[item]: # (/slide)

[item]: # (slide)

* You could manually resolve the conflict, but instead... 
* Abort the merge/pull

```
git merge --abort 
```

[item]: # (/slide)

[item]: # (slide)

## Rebasing

* Another way to merge changes between branches/forks 
* Apply all the commits from the source branch, then reapply local changes
* Not always possible to automatically complete

[item]: # (slide)

* Pull again, but with the rebase option 

```
git pull --rebase upstream master
```

[item]: # (/slide)

[item]: # (slide)

```
# Output

From https://github.com/imapex-training/101-github-lab
 * branch            master     -> FETCH_HEAD

The copy of the patch that failed is found in: /tmp/101-github-lab/.git/rebase-apply/patch

When you have resolved this problem, run "git rebase --continue".
If you prefer to skip this patch, run "git rebase --skip" instead.
To check out the original branch and stop rebasing, run "git rebase --abort".
```

* Oh darn... still a merge conflict

[item]: # (/slide)

[item]: # (slide)

* Open `CONTRIBUTORS.txt` and fix the merge conflict

```
$ cat CONTRIBUTORS.txt

```

[item]: # (/slide)

[item]: # (slide)

* As the error message said `When you have resolved this problem, run "git rebase --continue".`

```
git add CONTRIBUTORS.txt
git rebase --continue
```
```

* Check the status of your repository

```
$ git status

On branch master
Your branch and 'origin/master' have diverged,
and have 2 and 2 different commits each, respectively.
  (use "git pull" to merge the remote branch into yours)
nothing to commit, working tree clean
```

[item]: # (/slide)

This message is fairly descriptive.  Because of the rebase, we have diverged from our "origin/master".  We need to resolve this through "git pull" to get ourselves back in sync.  

[item]: # (slide)

* Pull our remote changes back down 

```
git pull
```
```
# Output 

Auto-merging CONTRIBUTORS.txt

[item]: # (slide)

* Just clear the conflict indicators from the file.

### Some final thoughts

* Merge conflicts **ALWAYS** require extra work to resolve
* You should try to avoid them by 
    * Only having one developer work on a single portion of code at a time
    * Merging feature branches in as soon as possible
* Rebasing, like any merging isn't always automatic

# Working With Others

> You have your way. I have my way. As for the right way, the correct way, and the only way, it does not exist. ~ Friedrich Nietzsche

[item]: # (/slide)

There are many opinions on the "right" way to collaborate on development projects.  These typically relate to topics such as 

* When to fork vs branch
* Who should have access to the project repository
* When to open issues
* The significance of the "master" branch
* And many other topics

Like many topics, there is not true "right" way, however there are many opinions available.  Often these opinions were developed after many projects and scars from attempting something one way vs another.  

And also like many lessons in life, sometimes you won't understand until you make the mistake yourself.  That said... 

[item]: # (slide)

## Some suggestions to consider

* Production deployments will be done from the master branch
* All feature development should be done via the developers fork and within a branch
* All feature development should have an open issue tagged enhancement for tracking purposes
* All bug fixes should have an open issue for tracking purposes

# Why do we care?

[item]: # (/slide)

It could be said that the number one skill you need as a modern developer is how to effectively use source control.  As git (and GitHub) are the most widely used tools in modern development, investing the time to become a power user of these tools is critical for your success.

## Go Do it Exercises

Find a partner and complete these exercises 

* Each of you create a new GitHub Repo and Local Clone
    * *Do NOT name your repos the same thing, this will cause conflict*
* One partner create a text file of all 50 States in the USA (one per line)
* The other partner create a text file of all the Presidents of the USA (one per line)
* Fork each others repos and add the Captials and Vice Presidents respectively
* Open Issues and Pull requests to resolve these problems
