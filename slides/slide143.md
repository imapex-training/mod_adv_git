### Some final thoughts

* Merge conflicts **ALWAYS** require extra work to resolve
* You should try to avoid them by 
    * Only having one developer work on a single portion of code at a time
    * Merging feature branches in as soon as possible
* Rebasing, like any merging isn't always automatic
