#### Merge Notes

* If you decide you do NOT want to complete the merge, you can run `git merge --abort` instead
* Many IDEs provide graphical interfaces for resolving merge conflicts that simplify the process
* Some merge conflicts can result in many instances of conflicting lines across multiple files
    * The same process is used to resolve, but it can be more complicated 
    * In cases like these, rather than merging into `master` directly, an integration branch can be safer 
    * Keeping commits and feature branches small is a good to try to limit these cases
