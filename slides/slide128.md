## Syncing a Repository to multiple Remotes

**Remember:** 

* "Distributed" Source Control = Multiple Copies
* "origin" is just an alias that points to your GitHub Repository
* The commands `git push` and `git pull` take an optional argument referencing the remote
* "Upstream" is a common name for a repository that was the source of a "fork"
